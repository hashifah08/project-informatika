        <p>Carnaval Our group chose this name because carnival is an activity that is similar to an exhibition and a bazaar. That is why we want to promote the sale of beverage products from one of our group members. Carnaval also has a meaning that reflects our group, namely Creative because we have creative ideas and Valuable because each of us has an important role and helps each other in the process of making this project.</p>
